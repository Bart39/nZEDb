Columns that might need changing in scripts:
binaries : totalParts
collections : totalFiles
anything with ID


Things to make compatible in queries:
ON DUPLICATE
REGEXP
UNIX_TIMESTAMP(example) to extract(epoch FROM example)";
COMPRESS() and DECOMPRESS()

Possible things to change:
$row = $db->queryOneRow("SELECT DATE_FORMAT(max(postdate), '%d/%m/%Y') AS postdate FROM releases");
$airdate = ($airdate > -1) ? sprintf(" AND releases.tvairdate >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL %d DAY) ", $airdate) : '';
